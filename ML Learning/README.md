### **Regression**
> Regression analysis is a form of predictive modeling technique which investigate the relationship between a dependent and independent variable. 
> * Determining the strength of predictors 
> * Forecasting an effect
> * Trend Forecasting 

### **Linear Vs Logistic Regression**

Basis | Linear Regression | Logistic Regression 
------ | ------- | --------
 **Core Concept** | The data is modelled using a straight line | The probability of some obtained event is represented as a linear function of a combination of predictor variable
 **Used with** | Continuous variable | Categorical Variable
 **Output/Predction** | Value of the variable | Probability of occurence of the event
 **Accurecy and goodness of fit** | Measured by loss, R Squared, Adjusted R squared etc | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC curve, Confusion Matrix etc


### **Linear Regression Selection Criteria**
> * Classification and Regression capabilities 
> * Data Quality
> * Computational Complexity
> * Comprehensible and Transparent
